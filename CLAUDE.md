# CLAUDE.md — Portfolio 3.0 (codex-technical-tide-v2)

## Project Overview

This is Kyle Semple's professional portfolio site. It is a React + TypeScript + Vite application with a Tailwind CSS design system, an Express server backend, and a Gemini-powered Digital Twin chatbot. It deploys via Docker multi-stage build to Google Cloud Run.

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start Vite dev server (frontend only)
npm run serve            # Start Express backend server
npm run dev:full         # Start both concurrently

# Validation (run after every subphase)
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript type checking (zero errors required)
npm run lint             # ESLint (zero warnings required)
npm run test             # Vitest test suite
npm run build            # Full production build (tsc + vite build)
npm run format:check     # Prettier formatting check

# Specialized
npm run generate:crawler-html   # Generate static crawler HTML
npm run build:crawler           # Build + generate crawler HTML
npm run defense:codex           # Run appellate defense script
```

## Design System Rules

These rules are non-negotiable. Violating them will result in a failed review.

### Typography Contrast
- **Light mode primary text**: Pure black `#000000` or `text-slate-950`. Never use mid-grey for body copy.
- **Light mode subtext**: `text-slate-600` or warm amber-tinted grey. Never lighter than `text-slate-600`.
- **Dark mode primary text**: `text-white` or `text-slate-50`.
- **Dark mode subtext**: `text-slate-200` or `text-zinc-300`. Never darker than `text-slate-300`.
- All dark mode body text must meet WCAG AAA (7:1 contrast ratio minimum).

### Card & Border Treatment
- **NO glassmorphism.** No `backdrop-blur` with translucent white fills. This is a hallmark of generic AI-generated sites and is explicitly banned by the project's design principles.
- **Light mode cards**: Solid `border-slate-200` on `bg-white` or `bg-slate-50`.
- **Dark mode cards**: Solid `border-slate-800` on `bg-[#0B0F19]` or `bg-slate-900`. Hover states may use `hover:border-amber-500/30` for warm accent.
- Borders must be razor-thin (1px) and clearly visible in both themes.

### Anti-Patterns (from .impeccable.md — MUST AVOID)
1. Generic SaaS startup template aesthetics (indigo/purple gradients, glassmorphism, hero metric tiles, gradient text)
2. Overly corporate/stuffy layouts
3. Design-flex creative portfolio (wrong audience)
4. Plain developer resume site (forgettable)

### Design Principles (from .impeccable.md)
1. Evidence over assertion — show the work, not claim it
2. Scannable at speed, rewarding at depth — 90-second clear path; deeper exploration reveals substance
3. Distinctly human — signal a real person with taste, not a template
4. Confident restraint — hierarchy through space and weight, not effects
5. One clear step ahead — feel designed by someone who knows what's coming

## Formatting

- Prettier config is in `package.json` (printWidth: 100, singleQuote: true, trailingComma: all)
- Always run `npm run format` after edits, then verify with `npm run format:check`
- Line endings: LF

## Git Commit Convention

Use conventional commits with the subphase identifier:
```
feat: subphase 1.1 — contrast correction & typography hardening
fix: subphase 4.1 — markdown parsing regression
style: subphase 1.1 — dark mode border contrast boost
```

## Sequential Execution Protocol

This project uses a phased execution plan. See the master execution plan document for the full sequence. The critical rule is:

**ONE SUBPHASE AT A TIME.**

After completing a subphase:
1. Run the full validation suite: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build`
2. Commit with the subphase identifier
3. STOP and report what was done
4. Wait for explicit approval before starting the next subphase

Do NOT read ahead and pre-implement tasks from later subphases. Each subphase builds on the verified output of the previous one.
