## [2.2.0] — 2026-06-04 — Phase 6 — Positioning Refactor (Forward Deployed Engineer)

### Changed

- Reframed the site around a single professional thesis — Kyle Semple as a **Forward Deployed Engineer** who helps teams turn complex technical, operational, and spatial problems into systems people can understand, adopt, and use — replacing the prior role-track-led information architecture.
- Demoted the three role tracks to supporting **role lenses** (Forward Deployed Engineer, Implementation Consultant, Spatial Systems Architect): lower-priority metadata and a secondary navigation dropdown rather than the primary framing. All `/tracks/*` routes are preserved.
- Added a "What I Help Teams Do" proof-pillar section to the homepage and a stakeholder/customer-value layer (purpose · value · role relevance · proof type) to project cards and major case studies; fixed the `useCaseStudyContent` loader so Guynode and Digital Twin render full bodies.
- Updated the Digital Twin assistant to explain Kyle via the thesis and route visitors by need, and aligned crawler/LLM machine-readable summaries to the Forward Deployed Engineer positioning.
- Surfaced the existing `/gallery` route in both the top and sidebar navigation while preserving every prior link; kept Customer Success as an evidence layer only (no CSM seniority, book of business, or ARR/NRR claims).

### Documentation

- Rewrote the README "Current Portfolio Architecture" section and phase sequence to describe the Forward Deployed Engineer model; positioning north star tracked in `AGENTS.md` and the full subphase plan in `docs/positioning-refactor-plan.md`.

### Validation

- Re-ran the local validation suite — `npm run format:check`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test -- --run`, and `npm run build` — plus `npm run generate:crawler-html` and `npm run validate:crawler`; the crawler validator passes.

### Why

This phase moves the portfolio from a "choose your Kyle" role-track menu to one coherent professional argument with role relevance attached as supporting evidence, without removing any existing routes or fabricating projects, customers, or metrics. Northern Grind is published; MOH and case-study content consolidation remain gated follow-ups (subphases 6.11–6.12).

## [2.1.2] — 2026-05-05 — Phase 2E Final QA Hardening

### Changed

- Hardened Process Deep Dive hash navigation by mapping legacy/internal anchors (including `#projects-architecture-migration`, `#decision-log`, and `#remaining-release-hardening`) to the correct major tab so anchored entry points reveal visible content instead of hidden tab panels.
- Verified Skills Inspector proof links for `ops-triage`, `guynode`, and `project-aegis` against existing canonical `/projects/:projectId` routes and retained current paths to avoid introducing route-constant circular imports.

### Validation

- Re-ran local validation commands for formatting, type safety, linting, tests, build, crawler generation, and crawler validation.
- Verified the existing Vite chunk-size warning remains informational and unchanged in severity for this phase; no risky bundler architecture changes were introduced.

### Why

This release closes Phase 2E with low-risk reliability hardening for anchored process navigation and route-safe proof linking while preserving existing architecture and crawler/static outputs.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-05-04 — Technical Tide / Gilded Variant Remediation Packaging

### Changed

- Packaged the Technical Tide — Gilded Variant palette migration stabilization as an evidence-bank remediation record, including root-cause framing, decision-impact narrative, architecture maturity note, and before/after governance summary in `docs/portfolio2-evidence-audit-ledger.md`.
- Consolidated remediation outcomes around the established design-system foundation: shared role/project/category/status recipes, dark-mode + prose cleanup direction, local map reduction in migrated surfaces, and metadata contract hardening coverage.

### Validation

- Confirmed local validation suite pass for:
  - `npm run format:check`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test -- --run`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run generate:crawler-html`
  - `npm run validate:crawler`
- Crawler generation and crawler validation remained preserved; no crawler architecture changes were introduced.

### Why

This release packages the completed remediation as a portfolio proof artifact so future reviewers can trace problem → root cause → decision → action → validation → impact without inferring implementation governance from raw diffs.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-28 — Final QA & Release Prep

### Changed

- Refactored homepage + track routing flow to keep the three role-track lanes and Guynode-first proof hierarchy stable for release
- Centralized default Supporting Evidence navigation in `src/lib/routes.ts` and removed brittle `CASE_STUDY_REGISTRY[0]` routing dependencies in app navigation
- Updated case study navigator labeling from "Supporting Evidence Map" to "Supporting Evidence Navigator" for terminology consistency
- Hardened track-page contact CTAs to open the contact modal directly instead of relying on hash links

### Documentation

- README updated with an explicit "Current Portfolio Architecture" section and the six-phase redesign sequence

### Why

This release finalizes Phase 6 by tightening route reliability, clarifying public terminology, and documenting the recruiter-facing information architecture before merge/deployment.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-21 — KS_01 Design Pivot

### Changed

- Hero redesigned from center-aligned SaaS template pattern to editorial layout compliant with all five `.impeccable.md` design principles
- Removed pill badge, dual equal-weight CTAs, and center-aligned layout — each flagged as anti-reference violations
- Design system shifted away from glassmorphism toward confident restraint: hierarchy through space and weight, not effects

### Added

- `.impeccable.md` — design constraints and anti-references document, now committed to main
- Tag `v1.5.0-pre-redesign` preserves the prior state before this pivot for historical reference

### Why

The original hero was evaluated against the anti-references in `.impeccable.md` and found to match the generic SaaS startup template pattern — the highest-priority failure mode listed. The KS_01 redesign was built against the five positive design principles and passed all five. Prior state is preserved at `v1.5.0-pre-redesign`. Decision rationale documented in full in `HOW_IT_WAS_BUILT.md`.
